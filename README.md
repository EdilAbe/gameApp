# GameApp

The Goal for this project is to understand the core features of Spring Framework

Design a game runner to run games(Mario, SupreContra, Pacman etc) in an iterative approach:

### Iteration 1 : Tightly coupled Java code
Use GameRunner class to run the Game classes: Mario, SuperContra, Pacman etc

### Iteration 2 : Loose coupling  -Interfaces
GameRunner class
Create GameConsole interface and have all classes implement that interface

### Iteration 3: Loose coupling - Spring level 1
Create Spring Beans
Spring framework will manage objects and wiring

### Iteration 4: Loose Coupling - Spring Level 2
Spring Annotations
Spring framework will create, manage & autowire objects
